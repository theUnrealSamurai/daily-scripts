# EverydayScripts
A repository containing a bunch of scripts that I use to automate my everyday brain-dead tasks


* Auto twitch.py
  made to automatically stream the brawlhalla twitch streams to get the viewership rewards.

* Gogo.py <abandoned due to updated captchas in the website>
  started off planning to download a series of anime at one go. now the the script is abandoned due to the existence of captchas in the website.

* mp4_time_calc.py
  Downloaded a folder full of tutorials and want to know how long the whole length is? just run this script, you'll get the total length of all the videos in the folder added together.
  
  
* Json_delete.py
  If you donwload a backup from the google photos the backup will have a json for each image. containing the details like location, time, date etc... If you want to just delete just run this script to remove only json of all the pictures.
  tip: point the path variable to the location of Takeout/GooglePhotos
