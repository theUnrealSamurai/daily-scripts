# EverydayScripts
A repository containing a bunch of scripts that I use to automate my everyday brain-dead tasks


* Auto twitch.py
  made to automatically stream the brawlhalla twitch streams to get the viewership rewards.

* Gogo.py <abandoned due to updated captchas in the website>
  started off planning to download a series of anime at one go. now the the script is abandoned due to the existence of captchas in the website.
